Modelling signal transduction
===================================


## Course Aims and Overview

This course teaches the basics of bio-image processing, segmentation and analysis in python. It is based on tutorials that integrate explanations and exercises, enabling participants to build their own image analysis pipeline step by step.

The `main_tutorial` uses single-cell segmentation of a confocal fluorescence microscopy image to illustrate key concepts from preprocessing to segmentation to data analysis. It includes a tutorial on how to apply such a pipeline to multiple images at once (batch processing).

The main tutorial is complemented by the `pre-tutorial`, which reviews some basic python concepts using as an example a rat fibroblast image, and by the `optional_advanced_content`, which features further examples and tutorials on the topics of vectorization, multiprocessing, cluster computation and advanced data analysis.

This course is aimed at people with basic to intermediate knowledge of python and basic knowledge of microscopy. For people with basic knowledge of image processing, the tutorials can be followed without attending the lectures.


## Instructions on following this course

- If you have only very basic knowledge of python or if you are feeling a little rusty, you should start with the `pre-tutorial`, which includes three tutorials: one on numpy arrays, one on python functions and one on the basics of interacting with image data in Python. If you are more experienced, you may want to skim or skip the pre-tutorial.
Note: The pre-tutorial is organized as an iPython notebook.

- In the `main_tutorial`, it is recommended to follow the `tutorial_pipeline` first. By following the exercises, you should be able to implement your own segmentation pipeline. If you run into trouble, you can use the provided solutions as inspiration - however, it is *highly* recommended to spend a lot of time figuring things out yourself, as this is an important part of any programming exercise. If you are having a lot of trouble, you may want to use the `partial_solutions`, which give you some help yet still demand that you think about it yourself. After completing the segmentation pipeline, you can follow the `tutorial_pipeline_batch` to learn how to run your program for several images and collect all the results.
Note: The main tutorial is organized simply as comments in an empty script. It is up to you to fill in the appropriate code.

- Finally, the `advanced_content` contains an introductory example to three important techniques for making making your scripts faster and operating on large datasets, namely *vectorization*, *multiprocessing* and *cluster processing*. The `data_analysis` tutorial (currently in *BETA*!) is an introduction to piping segmentation results into more advanced statistical data analysis, including *feature extraction*, *PCA*, *clustering* and *graph-based analysis*.
