## README Pre-Tutorial on Image Processing and Analysis with Python


### DESCRIPTION
Here you can find a tutorial that introduces basic, but necessary, concepts of digital images and their manipulation with Python. It also has a short tutorial on the Python library NumPy and another on Python functions.

This course assumes a basic knowledge of the Python Programming Language.


### REQUIREMENTS
- Python 2.7 (we recommend the Anaconda distribution, which includes most of the required modules)
- Modules: NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, tifffile
- A text/code editor 


### PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS AND CONTENT DISCUSSED IN THIS TUTORIAL
- The Python NumPy library to manipulate images
- Making functions in Python
- Manipulating images with Python


### IMAGE PROCESSING CONCEPTS AND CONTENT DISCUSSED IN THIS TUTORIAL
- The numerical and array nature of digital images
- Bit-depth, variable types and data types of images in Python
- Grayness resolution, RGB format and look up tables
- Image arithmetic and unexpected errors due to data type



### HOW TO FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL
- Files you should have: ipython notebooks titled `pre-tutorial.ipynb`, `arrays-and-numpy.ipynb` and `tutorial-on-functions.ipyn`.
- To start the ipython notebooks, start a new terminal window and type “jupyter notebook”, then press enter. When a new browser window opens, navigate to the folder where you have saved the tutorials. Click on the tutorial that you want to follow.  
- Using Jupyter notebook: When you want to type code into a cell, simply click on it to activate it. When you want to run the code, press shift+enter. You can learn how to use Jupyter notebooks from, e.g., https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
