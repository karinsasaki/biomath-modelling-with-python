    "In this tutorial you will learn in detail about the deterministic formalism for the *temporal* modelling of *simple*\\* chemical systems, and you will learn to write a simulation program, from scratch, using Python 2.7. This tutorial goes hand in hand with the slides.\n",

    "## Parameter estimation - in brief\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter estimation is the attempt to determine the values of the kinetic constants or other parameter values of a specific model from experimental data. This is a crucial step in model construction, at the same time it is a step which has to face uncertainty on different levels: uncertainty about the network structure of the model, uncertainty in the experimental data, and uncertainty in the conditions under which the experimental data have been measured. Essentially, we can employ both quantitative and qualitative data to restrict the range of possible parameter values. In most cases, it is not possible to determine parameter values uniquely. Often, we find many sets of parameter values that can equally well explain the data. To discriminate among those sets, one may employ additional investigations of the model under various conditions.\n",

    "A number of computational tools are available to enable parameter estimation. Among them is the frequently used tool Copasi, but you can also write your own program, as illustrated bellow, for the simple system of decay. Go through the program and make sure you undertand it."

    "The response of yeast to osmotic stress has been described by a model [1] that comprises the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, transcriptional regulation, the effect on metabolism and the change in the production of glycerol and an additional model describing regulation of volume and osmotic pressure (see figure). The HOG pathway consists of two input branches, the Sln1 branch and the Sho1 branch (which is not considered in the model). The receptor Sln1 is a membrane protein that senses the osmotic changes. Under normal conditions, it is continuously phosphorylated and transmits its phosphate group to Ypd1, which in turn passes it on to Ssk1. In this way, Ssk1 is kept phosphorylated and inactive. This module consisting of Sln1, Ypd1, and Ssk1 is a so-called phosphorelay system. Upon osmotic stress, phosphorylation of Sln1 is interrupted and Ssk1 switches to a non-phosphorylated, active state. In this form, it triggers the HOG MAP kinase cascade, which involves the redundant proteins Ssk2 and Ssk22 as well as Pbs2 and Hog1. Phosphorylated Hog1 can enter the nucleus and regulate the transcription of a series of genes.\n",

Omitting certain processes from the models is based on the assumption that they have only a minor influence on the event under study, that their values remain constant in the experimental setup, or that they simply cannot be described with the currently available means. For example, the effect of regulated gene expression is usually neglected in the modeling of metabolic networks although modelers are certainly aware of production and degradation of enzymes. But the different time scales of protein turnover and metabolic reactions justify this simplification in many cases.\n",
